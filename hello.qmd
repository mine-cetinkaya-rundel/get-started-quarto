## Meet the penguins

library(palmerpenguins)
```

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `r nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## A first look at penguins

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

#|   Scatterplot of bill length vs. flipper length

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange", "purple", "cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", 
    y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", 
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
